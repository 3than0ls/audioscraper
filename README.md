# Audioscraper

Download audiobooks by web scraping CafeAudioBooks to find the audio sources, and download them from there.

## WARNING:

Not heavily tested. Never trust things you download off the internet, whether it is this Python script (which you can look through to trust) or content downloaded from online.

This is purely a hobby project
